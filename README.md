# Data Gathering Projects

This repository contains two projects related to data gathering: one using an API and the other using web scraping.

## API Project

This project utilizes a public API to collect data on a specific topic. The API allows for easy access to data through HTTP requests, which are then processed and analyzed as needed.

### Installation

To install and run the API project, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install any necessary dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the main script to start collecting data from the API.

### Usage

Once the API project is set up, you can use it to gather data by making HTTP requests to the API endpoint. The collected data can then be stored, processed, and analyzed according to your requirements.

### Contributing

Contributions to the API project are welcome! If you'd like to contribute, please follow these guidelines:
- Fork the repository and create a new branch for your feature or fix.
- Make your changes and ensure they pass any existing tests.

## Web Scraping Project

This project involves scraping data from websites using web scraping techniques. It retrieves information from HTML pages and parses it to extract relevant data, such as text, links, or images.

### Installation

To install and run the web scraping project, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install any necessary dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the main script to start scraping data from the specified websites.

### Usage

After setting up the web scraping project, you can use it to gather data by specifying the target websites and the information you want to extract. The scraped data can be saved to files or databases for further analysis.

### Contributing

Contributions to the web scraping project are encouraged! If you'd like to contribute, please adhere to these guidelines:
